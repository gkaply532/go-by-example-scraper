# Go by Example Scraper

After going through [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/), doing the
given exercises and then reading [Go by
Example](https://gobyexample.com/), I decided that my first go project
will be a web scraper that finds links given in the go by example
website so I can read the mentioned blog posts, find out the used
packages etc.
